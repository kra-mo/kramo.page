    A project I had taken on to learn how to craft my own design system and build a product straight from scratch. I
    decided to go with a friendly but professional look and feel to fit the target audience of the desktop and web
    application. I designed the user interface, as well as all of its icons with this philosophy in mind. Through user
    testing and feedback, I have succeeded in creating a friendly photo editing experience that I am still iterating on.

    Video Player, codenamed “Showtime” was designed to replace the previous default video player in GNOME. It was
    designed to be familiar to users of the existing project, with

    based on its design. After discussions regarding similar styling across the ecosystem, I decided to give the project
    its own vidual identity, retaining a friendly, user-centered experience.

    The first significant project whose design I was responsible to lead. It taught me how to apply the skills that I
    had learned by creating prototypes and making smaller contributions to create a wholistic experience. I have learned
    how to closely work within a comprehensive design system and successfully apply it to a specific use case.
