    <h2>Interactions and Animation</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that the smallest interactions can make the user interface
        feel natural and alive. I strive towards delivering immersive
        experiences free from distractions.

        A project I had taken on to learn how to craft my own design system and
        build a product straight from scratch. I decided to go with a friendly
        but professional look and feel to fit the target audience of the desktop
        and web application. I designed the user interface, as well as all of
        its icons with this philosophy in mind. Through user testing and
        feedback, I have succeeded in creating a friendly photo editing
        experience that I am still iterating on.

        Video Player, codenamed “Showtime” was designed to replace the previous
        default video player in GNOME. It was designed to be familiar to users
        of the existing project, with

            >initial mockups</a
        >
        based on its design. After discussions regarding similar styling across
        the ecosystem, I decided to give the project its own vidual identity,
        retaining a friendly, user-centered experience.

        The first significant project whose design I was responsible to lead. It
        taught me how to apply the skills that I had learned by creating
        prototypes and making smaller contributions to create a wholistic
        experience. I have learned how to closely work within a comprehensive
        design system and successfully apply it to a specific use case.

    <h2>Icons</h2>
    <p>
        I have designed icons from symbolics and app icons to even emoji. You
